        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
          The idea to do an independent study course with Dr. Stamatis Vokos first arose in Fall of 2015.
          He was teaching me about special relativity, which I found to draw me in intensely.
          I loved how confusing and yet sensical it seemed. I loved finding semi-magical behaviors of things in our oh-so-normal universe.
          Naturally, I wanted more. Dr. Vokos was interested in learning a bit about VPython, so we agreed to barter our knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          This website is a product of a quarter spent trying to understand general relativity. Honestly, for a while,
          I wasn't sure that I was fully grasping the concepts. I still tend to think in terms of what's "actually" happening,
          when the fact of the matter is that general relativity is all about what's <strong>relative</strong>, not what is absolute.
        </p>
        <p>
          The math and concepts introduced with spinning black holes has wholly reinforced my ideas on general relativity.
          I feel so much more comfortable with the Schwarzschild metric now that I've been exposed to the Kerr metric.
          I wanted to present my knowledge here, so that others could see my potential and I could be proud of the progress I've made.
          I imagine that there will be three different types of people who view this page:
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps you are somebody who I am trying to impress. That is, either you're a potential hiring manager, a graduate school admissions officer,
          or somebody else who got a hold of my resume or domain name. I want you to know that I struggled a lot through this material. I will also struggle
          a lot when learning your material. That being said, I am an extremely devoted, passionate, and energetic learner. I learn things quickly in any field,
          and even if I am a novice in your area, I will yearn to understand it. I believe that with enough effort, I can learn anything.
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps you stumbled upon this website when searching for explanations on extreme Kerr black holes. I wish you luck in grasping these concepts.
          It certainly took me a lot of effort. I hope that what I have published here can help guide you. I have tried to show all
          necessary steps through the math, which might help if you're anything like me. I have been using the textbook <i> Exploring
          Black Holes </i> by Edwin F Taylor and John A Wheeler. I think Taylor does a great job explaining the more basic concepts of black holes, if you're
          still fuzzy on the Schwarzschild radius and such. <a href="http://www.eftaylor.com/">Click on this text to go to his website.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, you might be somebody who personally knows me. I might have asked you to take a peek, just so you could see my passion for this topic.
          Thanks for reading through a little of it!
        </p>
        <p>
          I owe all of this expertise to Stamatis Vokos. He is truly an inspiring man and an excellent teacher and mentor. I wish him all the best
          in his new job at Cal Poly.
        </p>

          Now, onto the good stuff!

        <h2> Understanding the Kerr Metric </h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
          By now, you should be familiar with the Schwarzschild metric:
          $$ d\tau^2 = (1 - \frac {2M} r)dt^2 - \frac {dr^2} {(1- \frac {2M} r)} - r^2d\phi $$
          If you're saying to yourself "Where's $\theta$?", I say: $\theta$ only complicates things.
          In order to kill $\theta$, let's just imagine all of our events happening in a single equatorial plane
          around the gravitating body. The only change in angle is azimuthal, that is, on the equatorial plane.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Provide an image here for azimuthal angle</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, you should know that the Schwarzschild Metric only describes curved spacetime around
          <strong>non-spinning and uncharged</strong> gravitating bodies. Furthermore, in the rest of this page,
          I will be talking specifically about <strong>black holes unless denoted otherwise</strong>. These metrics
          do apply to any other astrophysical body in the universe, but black holes are the main focus here (and also
          where the most weird things happen).
        </p>
        <p>
          So now, let's imagine a spinning black hole. Behold, from the heavens, down falls the following metric:
          $$ d\tau^2 = (1 - \frac {2M} r)dt^2 + \frac {4Ma} r dtd\phi - \frac {dr^2} {1 - \frac {2M} r + \frac {a^2} {r^2}} - (1 + \frac {a^2} {r^2} + \frac {2Ma^2} {r^3})r^2d\phi$$
          Falling from the heavens indicates we do not need to derive this metric. However, that does not mean we shouldn't test it
          to see if it fits with our pre-established rules of general relativity. Our window is narrow, only encompassing the Schwarszchild metric,
          but can we make the Kerr metric still agree with everything the Schwarzschild metric declares?
        </p>
        <h3>Defining the Kerr Metric</h3>
        <p>
          The most obvious change from Schwarzschild to Kerr is the introduction of a new variable $a$. $a$ is the <strong>angular momentum parameter</strong>.
          The angular momentum parameter describes how "much" the black hole is spinning (in a loose sense).
          It is defined to be $a = \frac J M$, which is kind of annoying, because we don't know what $J$ is.
          Well, $J = \frac L m$. Aha! We know what $\frac L m$ is; it's the angular momentum of a particle with mass $m$.
          I will refresh you on some definitions of angular momentum, though.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using the Principle of Least Action (or Extremal Aging in <i>Exploring Black Holes</i>), we derived
          $$ \frac L m = r^2 \frac {d\phi} {d\tau} $$
          This means that the angular momentum is defined as the change in angle per wristwatch time, multiplied by the distance from the singularity (squared).
         </p>
         <p>
           So, the angular momentum parameter $a$ is simply the angular momentum of a black hole per unit mass (of said black hole).
           There aren't any other new variables, so let's continue with our analysis!
         </p>
         <h3>Testing the Kerr Metric</h3>
         <p>
           Here is the first and only test of the Kerr metric: when $a = 0$, does it condense to the Schwarszchild metric? Clearly,
           a non-spinning black hole will no angular momentum, and thus $a = 0$. Let's try it.

           $$ d\tau^2 = (1 - \frac {2M} r)dt^2 + \frac {4Ma} r dtd\phi - \frac {dr^2} {1 - \frac {2M} r + \frac {a^2} {r^2}} - (1 + \frac {a^2} {r^2} + \frac {2Ma^2} {r^3})r^2d\phi $$
           $$ d\tau^2 = (1 - \frac {2M} r)dt^2 + \frac {4M(0)} r dtd\phi - \frac {dr^2} {1 - \frac {2M} r + \frac {(0)^2} {r^2}} - (1 + \frac {(0)^2} {r^2} + \frac {2M(0)^2} {r^3})r^2d\phi $$
           $$ d\tau^2 = (1 - \frac {2M} r)dt^2 + 0 - \frac {dr^2} {1 - \frac {2M} r + 0} - (1 + 0 + 0)r^2d\phi $$
           $$ d\tau^2 = (1 - \frac {2M} r)dt^2 - \frac {dr^2} {1 - \frac {2M} r} - r^2d\phi $$

           Well, it looks right! We've now found that the Kerr metric works for non-spinning black holes,
           since it successfully whittles down to the Schwarzschild metric.
         </p>
         <p>
           The next test involves a bit more wordplay and less math. <strong>What would happen to a free object that begins to orbit a spinning black hole
           in the equatorial plane?</strong>
         </p>
         <p>
           It is apparent that the Kerr metric only depends on one static variable $r$. Since it does not depend on static $t$ or static $\phi$,
           but only $dt$ and $d\phi$ (changes in time or azimuthal angle), we can extrapolate that there are two constants of motion:
           one involved with $t$ and one involved with $\phi$. With the Schwarzschild metric, we called the constant for $t$ energy
           ($\frac E m = (1 - \frac {2M} r) \frac {dt} {d\tau}$) and the constant for $\phi$ angular momentum ($\frac L m = r^2 \frac {d\phi} {d\tau}$).
           Thus if the angular momentum is constant, then the object will not leave the equatorial plane unless acted on by an external force.
           This fits within our idea of conservation of momentum, and thus we can now believe in the Kerr metric. Now we can move onto the magic that
           happens around a spinning black hole.

        <h2>Properties of Spinning Black Holes</h2>
      <hr>
        <p>
          With the Schwarszchild metric, the first weirdness occurred when we set $r = 2M$. This made the $dr^2$ term blow up (aka $dr^2 \to \infty$).
          However, look again at the coefficient of the $dr^2$ term in the Kerr Metric.
          $$- \frac 1 {1 - \frac {2M} r + \frac {a^2} {r^2}}$$
          Now, even if $r = 2M$, the coefficient will be
          $$- \frac 1 {1 - 1 + \frac {a^2} {4M^2}}$$
          which means we will not be dividing by zero. This is a semi-problem, but a cool one nonetheless.
        </p>
        <p>
          The event horizon is a cool name for the limit $r = 2M$. But now, that doesn't hold much significance as the $dr^2$ term doesn't approach $\infty$.
          The new event horizon is defined by:
          $$r_h = M \pm \sqrt{(M^2 - a^2)} $$
          Let's run through this to so that we see what happens when we have various conditions of spin.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, let's imagine we have a non-spinning black hole ($a = 0$). What happens when we plug this into our new horizon coordinate?
          $$r_h = M \pm \sqrt{(M^2 - (0)^2)} $$
          $$r_h = M \pm \sqrt{M^2}$$
          $$r_h = M \pm M$$
          Well, now we have shown that there is a horizon at $r=2M$ for non-spinning black holes, which is exactly what we get from the Schwarzschild metric.
          You might have noticed that we have two values for the horizon now, since we have a $\pm$ in there. With non-spinning black holes, there is a horizon
          at $r = 2M$ and $r = 0$. That seems kind of weird, but will be better understood once we go through the next steps.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you take any $a \gt 0$, you will find that both values of $r_h$ shrinks.
          <!-- We can also plug this into the Kerr metric's $dr^2$ coefficient and see what happens.
          $$ - \frac 1 {1 - \frac {2M} {r_h} + \frac {a^2} {{r_h}^2}} $$
          $$ - \frac 1 {1 - \frac {2M} {M \pm (M^2 - a^2)^{1/2}} + \frac {a^2} {(M \pm {(M^2 - a^2)}^{1/2})^2}} $$
          To simplify the problem, we know that the following quantity will have to equal $1$ in order to cause $dr^2$ to blow up. Let's solve
          from there.
          $$ \frac {2M} {M \pm (M^2 - a^2)^{1/2}} + \frac {a^2} {(M \pm {(M^2 - a^2)}^{1/2})^2} = 1 $$
          $$ \frac {4M^2 + a^2} {(M \pm {(M^2 - a^2)}^{1/2})^2} = 1 $$ -->
          It's simple to see that if $a \gt M$, then you get an imaginary number in the rooted term in $r_h$ ($M^2 - a^2 \lt 0$).
          Thus, the black hole cannot have angular momentum greater than $M$.
        </p>
        <h3>Two Horizons</h3>
        <p>
          Right now, you may be asking yourself: <strong>"What the heck does it mean to have two horizons? I mean, the event horizon is where space
          gets all wonky, but with spinning black holes, what happens when either value of the horizon is reached?"</strong> Let's plug in some values
          and check it out.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, let's take $\frac a M = \sqrt{\frac 3 4}$ (a personal favorite of Taylor). This makes $r_h = 1.5M$ and $.5M$.
          The event horizon is defined to be $1.5M$, and most of the behaviors attributed to the event horizon hold here.
          The horizon at $.5M$ is called the <strong>Cauchy horizon</strong>. For more information,
          <a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/what-is-the-significance-of-the-cauchy-horizon.52876/">go to this link.</a>
          I'm not going to focus on this inner horizon at all, but it is a cool thought experiment.
        </p>
        <p>
          We define a black hole to be <strong>EXTREME</strong> when $a = M$. From a few steps, we'll see that the event horizon and Cauchy horizon intersect around an extreme black hole (EBH).
          $$ r_h = M \pm \sqrt{(M^2 - M^2)} $$
          $$ r_h = M $$
          There's only one value for $r_h$ now; this means that the two horizons are at the same r-coordinate. We'll explore more about EBHs soon.
        </p>
        <h3>The New Metric</h3>
        <p>
          Extreme black holes are really cool. After all, they're <strong>EXTREME</strong>! Regardless, I want to plug in $a = M$ to the metric to see what happens.
          $$ d\tau^2 = (1 - \frac {2M} r)dt^2 + \frac {4Ma} r dtd\phi - \frac {dr^2} {1 - \frac {2M} r + \frac {a^2} {r^2}} - (1 + \frac {a^2} {r^2} + \frac {2Ma^2} {r^3})r^2d\phi $$
          $$ d\tau^2 = (1 - \frac {2M} r)dt^2 + \frac {4M(M)} r dtd\phi - \frac {dr^2} {1 - \frac {2M} r + \frac {(M)^2} {r^2}} - (1 + \frac {(M)^2} {r^2} + \frac {2M(M)^2} {r^3})r^2d\phi $$
          $$ d\tau^2 = (1 - \frac {2M} r)dt^2 + \frac {4M^2} r dtd\phi - \frac {dr^2} {(1 - \frac M r)^2} - (r^2 + M^2 + \frac {2M^3} {r})d\phi $$
          We define $R^2 = r^2 + M^2 + \frac {2M^3} {r}$ so now:
          $$ d\tau^2 = (1 - \frac {2M} r)dt^2 + \frac {4M^2} r dtd\phi - \frac {dr^2} {(1 - \frac M r)^2} - R^2d\phi $$
          This isn't exactly a new metric, but it does eliminate the pesky $a$ term and assumes extreme Kerr spacetime geometry (EKS).
          <strong style="color:red">From now on I will use EBH and EKS unless denoted otherwise.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          But now, briefly, pat yourself on the back if you said: "Wait, the limit $r = 2M$ is still important in the Kerr metric! Instead of the $dr^2$ term blowing up,
          the $dt^2$ term goes to $0$! What does that even mean?" You're not alone. It took me a while to understand the significance. What we're talking about is in the
          first term of the Kerr metric, namely:
          $$ (1- \frac {2M} r)dt^2 $$
          When $r = 2M$, that coefficient turns into a big fat $0$.
          This beautiful thing is called the <strong>static limit</strong>! It is very important to the weirdness that happens around spinning black holes.
          Inside the static limit, <strong>nothing can resist rotation around the black hole, not even light!</strong>

        <h2>The Static Limit</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
          The static limit and event horizon intersect for a non-spinning black hole ($a = 0$). This is because the $dt^2$ coefficient remains unchanged
          as we change from the Schwarzschild metric to the Kerr metric. The region given by $M < r < 2M$ is called the <strong>ergosphere</strong>. This region
          between the static limit and the event horizon is noticeably weird once you wade into the math.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, let's discuss the tangential motion of light. This means that the light is traveling with no change in radius ($dr^2 = 0$) and because it is light,
          our spacetime interval also is zero ($d\tau^2 = 0$). The EKS metric becomes:
          $$ 0 = (1 - \frac {2M} r)dt^2 + \frac {4M^2} r dtd\phi - R^2d\phi $$
          Before going any further, we need to understand what we're solving for.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our aim is to find $\frac {d\phi} {dt}$, which can be succintly explained as the change in azimuthal angle on the equatorial plane per tick on a clock at $r = \infty$.
          For those of you who are unfamiliar with Taylor's terms, he calls this $t$ interval the "bookkeeper". The bookkeeper is merely an observer outside of the effects
          of spacetime curvature around the black hole he/she is observing. So this interval $\frac {d\phi} {dt}$ is just the change in azimuthal angle light has, as observed
          by an observer extremely far away. Now to solve for it. Starting from the equation above...
          $$ 0 = (1 - \frac {2M} r) + \frac {4M^2} r \frac {d\phi} {dt} - R^2(\frac {d\phi} {dt})^2 $$
          Using the quadratic formula with $a = -R^2$, $b = \frac {4M^2} r$, and $c = (1 - \frac {2M} r)$, we get:
          $$ \frac {d\phi} {dt} = \frac {{-4M^2 \over r} \pm \sqrt{(\frac {4M^2} r)^2 - 4(-R^2)(1 - \frac {2M} r)}} {-2R^2} $$
          $$ \frac {d\phi} {dt} = {2M^2 \over rR^2} \pm \sqrt{({16M^4 \over r^2} + {1 \over R^2}(1 - {2M \over r}))({1 \over 4R^4})}$$
          $$ {d\phi \over dt} = {2M^2 \over rR^2} \pm \sqrt{ {4M^4 \over r^2R^4} + {1 \over R^2}(1-{2M \over r})} $$
          $$ {d\phi \over dt} = {2M^2 \over rR^2} \pm \sqrt{ {4M^4 \over r^2R^4} + ({4M^4 \over r^2R^4})({r^2R^2 \over 4M^4})(1-{2M \over r})} $$
          $$ {d\phi \over dt} = {2M^2 \over rR^2} \pm {2M^2 \over rR^2}\sqrt{1 + ({r^2R^2 \over 4M^4})(1-{2M \over r})} $$
        </p>
        <p>
          Alright, now we have a proper equation for ${d\phi \over dt}$. At the static limit, ${d\phi \over dt} = 0$ and ${1 \over 3M}$. What does this mean?
          First, the two values represent different initial directions for light. If you stood at the static limit and flashed your flashlight tangentially
          in the direction of the black hole's rotation, the bookkeeper would see it move with ${d\phi \over dt} = {1 \over 3M}$. In other words, it would
          move smoothly with the spacetime current.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, we see that if you were to shine your flashlight in the other direction... the bookkeeper would not see it change in its azimuthal angle
          around the black hole. The light would stand still. What does that even mean? This is one of the first signs that black holes can actually <strong>drag</strong>
          spacetime with them as they spin. The nice and easy geometry of the Schwarzschild metric is no more. Now we have twisty space around spinning black holes. Despite
          it being mildly more complicated, it's actually really interesting and fun. Even the Earth has this effect on spacetime. You can read more about it on
          <a href="https://einstein.stanford.edu/highlights/status1.html">this page</a> which explains an experiment in which researchers at Stanford used gyroscopes in
          satellites to determine how twisty space became in orbit around Earth.
