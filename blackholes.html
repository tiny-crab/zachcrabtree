        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          The idea to do an independent study course with Dr. Stamatis Vokos first arose in Fall of 2015.
          He was teaching me about special relativity, which I found to draw me in intensely.
          I loved how confusing and yet sensical it seemed. I loved finding semi-magical behaviors of things in our oh-so-normal universe.
          Naturally, I wanted more. Dr. Vokos was interested in learning a bit about VPython, so we agreed to barter our knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          This website is a product of a quarter spent trying to understand general relativity. Honestly, for a while,
          I wasn't sure that I was fully grasping the concepts. I still tend to think in terms of what's "actually" happening,
          when the fact of the matter is that general relativity is all about what's <strong>relative</strong>, not what is absolute.
        </p>
        <p>
          The math and concepts introduced with spinning black holes has wholly reinforced my ideas on general relativity.
          I feel so much more comfortable with the Schwarzschild metric now that I've been exposed to the Kerr metric.
          I wanted to present my knowledge here, so that others could see my potential and I could be proud of the progress I've made.
          I imagine that there will be three different types of people who view this page:
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps you are somebody who I am trying to impress. That is, either you're a potential hiring manager, a graduate school admissions officer,
          or somebody else who got a hold of my resume or domain name. I want you to know that I struggled a lot through this material. I will also struggle
          a lot when learning your material. That being said, I am an extremely devoted, passionate, and energetic learner. I learn things quickly in any field,
          and even if I am a novice in your area, I will yearn to understand it. I believe that with enough effort, I can learn anything.
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps you stumbled upon this website when searching for explanations on extreme Kerr black holes. I wish you luck in grasping these concepts.
          It certainly took me a lot of effort. I hope that what I have published here can help guide you. I have tried to show all
          necessary steps through the math, which might help if you're anything like me. I have been using the textbook <i> Exploring
          Black Holes </i> by Edwin F Taylor and John A Wheeler. I think EFT does a great job explaining the more basic concepts of black holes, if you're
          still fuzzy on the Schwarzschild radius and such. <a href="http://www.eftaylor.com/">Click on this text to go to his website.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, you might be somebody who personally knows me. I might have asked you to take a peek, just so you could see my passion for this topic.
          Thanks for reading through a little of it!
        </p>
        <p>
          I owe all of this expertise to Stamatis Vokos. He is truly an inspiring man and an excellent teacher and mentor. I wish him all the best
          in his new job at Cal Poly.

          Now, onto the good stuff!

        <h2> Understanding the Kerr Metric </h2>
        <p>
          By now, you should be familiar with the Schwarzschild metric:
          $$ d\tau^2 = (1 - \frac {2M} r)dt^2 - \frac {dr^2} {(1- \frac {2M} r)} - r^2d\phi $$
          If you're saying to yourself "Where's $\theta$?", I say: $\theta$ only complicates things.
          In order to kill $\theta$, let's just imagine all of our events happening in a single equatorial plane
          around the gravitating body. The only change in angle is azimuthal, that is, on the equatorial plane.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Provide an image here for azimuthal angle</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, you should know that the Schwarzschild Metric only describes curved spacetime around
          <strong>non-spinning and uncharged</strong> gravitating bodies. Furthermore, in the rest of this page,
          I will be talking specifically about <strong>black holes unless denoted otherwise</strong>. These metrics
          do apply to any other astrophysical body in the universe, but black holes are the main focus here (and also
          where the most weird things happen).
        </p>
        <p>
          So now, let's imagine a spinning black hole. Behold, from the heavens, down falls the following metric:
          $$ d\tau^2 = (1 - \frac {2M} r)dt^2 + \frac {4Ma} r dtd\phi - \frac {dr^2} {1 - \frac {2M} r + \frac {a^2} {r^2}} - (1 + \frac {a^2} {r^2} + \frac {2Ma^2} {r^3})r^2d\phi$$
          Falling from the heavens indicates we do not need to derive this metric. However, that does not mean we shouldn't test it
          to see if it fits with our pre-established rules of general relativity. Our window is narrow, only encompassing the Schwarszchild metric,
          but can we make the Kerr metric still agree with everything the Schwarzschild metric declares?
        </p>
        <h3>Defining the Kerr Metric</h3>
        <p>
          The most obvious change from Schwarzschild to Kerr is the introduction of a new variable $a$. $a$ is the <strong>angular momentum parameter</strong>.
          The angular momentum parameter describes how "much" the black hole is spinning (in a loose sense).
          It is defined to be $a = \frac J M$, which is kind of annoying, because we don't know what $J$ is.
          Well, $J = \frac L m$. Aha! We know what $\frac L m$ is; it's the angular momentum of a particle with mass $m$.
          I will refresh you on some definitions of angular momentum, though.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using the Principle of Least Action (or Extremal Aging in <i>Exploring Black Holes</i>), we derived
          $$ \frac L m = r^2 \frac {d\phi} {d\tau} $$
          This means that the angular momentum is defined as the change in angle per wristwatch time, multiplied by the distance from the singularity (squared).
         </p>
         <p>
           So, the angular momentum parameter $a$ is simply the angular momentum of a black hole per unit mass (of said black hole).
           There aren't any other new variables, so let's continue with our analysis!
         </p>
         <h3>Testing the Kerr Metric</h3>
         <p>
           Here is the first and only test of the Kerr metric: when $a = 0$, does it condense to the Schwarszchild metric? Clearly,
           a non-spinning black hole will no angular momentum, and thus $a = 0$. Let's try it.

           $$ d\tau^2 = (1 - \frac {2M} r)dt^2 + \frac {4Ma} r dtd\phi - \frac {dr^2} {1 - \frac {2M} r + \frac {a^2} {r^2}} - (1 + \frac {a^2} {r^2} + \frac {2Ma^2} {r^3})r^2d\phi $$
           $$ d\tau^2 = (1 - \frac {2M} r)dt^2 + \frac {4M(0)} r dtd\phi - \frac {dr^2} {1 - \frac {2M} r + \frac {(0)^2} {r^2}} - (1 + \frac {(0)^2} {r^2} + \frac {2M(0)^2} {r^3})r^2d\phi $$
           $$ d\tau^2 = (1 - \frac {2M} r)dt^2 + 0 - \frac {dr^2} {1 - \frac {2M} r + 0} - (1 + 0 + 0)r^2d\phi $$
           $$ d\tau^2 = (1 - \frac {2M} r)dt^2 - \frac {dr^2} {1 - \frac {2M} r} - r^2d\phi $$

           Well, it looks right! We've now found that the Kerr metric works for non-spinning black holes,
           since it successfully whittles down to the Schwarzschild metric.
         </p>
         <p>
           The next test involves a bit more wordplay and less math. <strong>What would happen to a free object that begins to orbit a spinning black hole
           in the equatorial plane?</strong>
         </p>
         <p>
           It is apparent that the Kerr metric only depends on one static variable $r$. Since it does not depend on static $t$ or static $\phi$,
           but only $dt$ and $d\phi$ (changes in time or azimuthal angle), we can extrapolate that there are two constants of motion:
           one involved with $t$ and one involved with $\phi$. With the Schwarzschild metric, we called the constant for $t$ energy
           ($\frac E m = (1 - \frac {2M} r) \frac {dt} {d\tau}$) and the constant for $\phi$ angular momentum ($\frac L m = r^2 \frac {d\phi} {d\tau}$).
           Thus if the angular momentum is constant, then the object will not leave the equatorial plane unless acted on by an external force.
           This fits within our idea of conservation of momentum, and thus we can now believe in the Kerr metric. Now we can move onto the magic that
           happens around a spinning black hole.

        <h2>Properties of Spinning Black Holes</h2>
        <p>
          With the Schwarszchild metric, the first weirdness occurred when we set $r = 2M$. This made the $dr^2$ term blow up (aka $dr^2 \to \infty$).
          However, look again at the coefficient of the $dr^2$ term in the Kerr Metric.
          $$- \frac 1 {1 - \frac {2M} r + \frac {a^2} {r^2}}$$
          Now, even if $r = 2M$, the coefficient will be
          $$- \frac 1 {1 - 1 + \frac {a^2} {4M^2}}$$
          which means we will not be dividing by zero. This is a semi-problem, but a cool one nonetheless.
        </p>
        <p>
          The event horizon is a cool name for the limit $r = 2M$. But now, that doesn't hold much significance as the $dr^2$ term doesn't approach $\infty$.
          The new event horizon is defined by:
          $$r_h = M \pm \sqrt{(M^2 - a^2)} $$
          Let's run through this to so that we see what happens when we have various conditions of spin.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, let's imagine we have a non-spinning black hole ($a = 0$). What happens when we plug this into our new horizon coordinate?
          $$r_h = M \pm \sqrt{(M^2 - (0)^2)} $$
          $$r_h = M \pm \sqrt{M^2}$$
          $$r_h = M \pm M$$
          Well, now we have shown that there is a horizon at $r=2M$ for non-spinning black holes, which is exactly what we get from the Schwarzschild metric.
          You might have noticed that we have two values for the horizon now, since we have a $\pm$ in there. With non-spinning black holes, there is a horizon
          at $r = 2M$ and $r = 0$. That seems kind of weird, but will be better understood once we go through the next steps.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you take any $a \gt 0$, you will find that one value of $r_h$ shrinks.
