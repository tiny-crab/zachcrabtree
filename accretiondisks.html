          <h2>Accretion Disk Basics</h2>
          <p>
            Accretion disks are large disks of matter that rotate and swirl around gravitating bodies.
            I find them fascinating due to their ubiquity in the formation of bodies in space.
            They can be found around black holes, contact/close binary systems, and in the process of protoplanetary formation.
            Perhaps the most stunning and neighborly accretion disks are the rings around Saturn, which are formed mostly of ice and dust.
          </p>
          <p>
            This website will focus on the formation of accretion disks around black holes (and the gamma ray bursts that result).
            My secondary focus will be the accretion disks that form from close binary systems,
            in which a primary star will “suck” matter away from a secondary star in such a way that it forms a disk.

          <h2>Formations</h2>
          <p>
            Accretion disks that evolve into protostars (baby stars) are formed from clouds of material that are disturbed by an external trigger.
            This causes an instability in the cloud and material begins to combine at a point.
            With more gravitational attraction at that point than others, more particles are attracted to the point and accrete into a larger and larger structure.
            This snowballs into a protostar.
          </p>
          <p>
            Black hole accretion disks are simply formed by matter falling into a near-miss orbit around the black hole.
            The black hole will spin the matter into a disk because of its intense gravitational pull.
            The plane in which the accretion disk forms is related to the average angular momentum of the particles in the body or cloud being spun.
            The accretion disk will slowly shrink, since the matter isn’t in a stable orbit.
            The matter will only “disappear” if it’s around a black hole.
            If it’s around another gravitating body, it will simply accrete on the surface of the body.
            The matter spins around more quickly as it gets closer to the gravitating body in order to conserve angular momentum.

          <h2>Angular Momentum Transfer</h2>
          <p>
            As gas particles fall into the black hole, they must lose angular momentum.
            Although the particles themselves do not have constant angular momentum, the accretion disk does have constant angular momentum.
            This is due to angular momentum transport, in which the gas particles at a smaller radius from the black hole transfer
            angular momentum to particles at a larger radius.
            This can be done in two ways: wind and collisions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Magnetohydrodynamic winds are more complex than basic collisions. They wick away angular momentum from the entire disk.
            In order for the gas to overcome the force of gravity from the disk (and the body which it is orbiting around)
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, momentum redistribution is comparatively simple.
            Just as two bodies can transfer angular momentum as they collide, so can particles in the accretion disk.
            Modelling this transfer of angular momentum from the inside to the outside of the disk is somewhat complex.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some math follows for those of you that like that kind of thing.

          <h3>Loss of Potential</h3>
          <p>
            If we estimate a disk where its thickness or height is much less than its radius $( h \lt \lt r )$, we say:
            "Screw the third dimension, let's just deal with it as if it's a circle." (at least that's what I say)
            So then, as the accretion disk begins to "rain" its matter on the surface of the star, the angular momentum must be transferred
            outward.
          </p>
          <p>
            As some interior radius of the disk $ R $ falls inward, it must lose potential energy $ \Delta E = \frac {GM} {R^2} dMdR $.

          <h2>Disk Luminosity</h2>
          <p>
            Accretion disks often become very bright due to the “fluid” nature of their structure.
            When matter is spun into an accretion disk, it is approximated to a fluid because of the numerous particles
            and pieces of material that are jostling against each other in their orbit.
            There is almost no stable orbit here for any given particle. We assume it to be just random motion.
            The whole disk can be assumed to be in a stable orbit but there isn’t any easy way to calculate the path of any given particle in the disk.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, due to this motion, we know that the disk will have a given temperature.
            Due to the number of particles and collisions, the temperatures can be so high that they give off X-rays!
            This temperature is caused by the collisions of material within the accretion disk.
            The disk also moves inward, toward the black hole.
            We know that the potential energy lost by accretion is Equation [1].
            Half of this energy is transferred into the rest of the disk, and half is radiated outward. Thus, the luminosity of a disk is represented by Equation [2].

          <h2>Astrophysical Jets</h2>
          <p>
            Astrophysical jets are extremely common in the universe.
            They are generated by many different bodies with accretion disks.
            The material ejected from the accretion disk along the axis of rotation of the gravitating often has a velocity
            equal to the escape velocity from that body’s gravitational pull at that radius!
            When jets are released from the pull of a black hole, they will reach incredibly large fractions of the speed of light,
            which are observed as gamma ray bursts.
            These are perhaps the most explosive and energetic events in the universe since the Big Bang.
            Gamma ray bursts can often have luminosities greater than 10<sup>50</sup> erg/s.
            In comparison, our Sun has a luminosity of approximately 2.8x10<sup>31</sup> erg/s.
            That’s 100,000,000,000,000,000,000 times brighter than our Sun.

          <h3>Jet Structure and Formation</h3>
          <p>
            Before diving into the velocity calculations of the jet, let's define a few terms. After a thorough reading of
            Elisebete M de Gouveia Dal Pino's wonderful research on <i> Astrophysical Jets and Outflows<sup>2</sup></i>, I found that her focus
            was on the structure and composition of an astrophysical jet, along with the ambient medium that it crashes through. As the jet is released
            from the grip of the body's gravity, it fires along the rotational axis of the body. The method by which it does this is mostly unknown<sup>3</sup>. It
            most likely has to do with the magnetohydrodynamic structure of the disk. After firing, it will proceed to cool radiatively, and slow down
            through the collision with these ambient clouds. The clouds of gas that it runs through will be injected with angular momentum.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the jet collides with the gas cloud, debris is kicked up from the fast jet particles smacking against the relatively inert gas particles.
            This structure is called the <i>bow shock</i>. These bright knots formed by this collision are much more common in jets formed by active galactic
            nuclei (AGNs), which usually are concentrated at a central black hole. Young star objects (YSOs) move slowly compared to AGN jets, so they often create
            fewer bow shocks. Their total angular momentum is smaller than AGN jets, so it is completely dispersed after just a few collisions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, time for the equation! This relates bow shock velocity to actual jet velocity.
            $$ v_{bs} \approx v_j \frac 1 {1 + {(\eta\alpha)}^{-1/2}} $$
            The two variables at the bottom, $ \eta $ (eta) and $ \alpha $ (alpha) are defined as follows:
            $$ \eta = \frac {n_j} {n_a} $$
            where $ \frac {n_j} {n_a} $ is the ratio of the number density of the jet to ambient gas.
            $$ \alpha = (\frac {R_j} {R_h})^2 $$
            where $ R_j $ is the radius of the jet beam, and $ R_h $ the radius of the jet head.
          </p>
          <p>
            From this, we can see a few relations. For a moment, let's take $ \eta = 1 $, so we can look at the how $ v_{bs} $ changes with $ \alpha $.
            If $ R_j = R_h $ (meaning the jet is not conic at all, but rather a cylinder), then the bow shock will move at approximately half the velocity of the jet.
            As $ R_h $ grows, the jet will become more conic, with the narrow point at the source of the jet (the black hole in our AGN case).
            As this happens, $ (\eta\alpha) \to 0 $ and thus $ (\eta\alpha)^{-1/2} \to \infty $. We can see now that as the jet is more conic, the bow shock will be
            much slower than the jet impacting the ambient cloud.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another neat relation is between the density of the ambient gas and density of the jet. If we assume a cylindrical jet ($\alpha = 1$), then
            as $\frac {n_j} {n_a} \to 0$ (the ambient gas is much denser than the jet), then $v_{bs} \to 0$. If the jet is much more dense than the cloud
            ($\frac {n_j} {n_a} \to \infty$), then $v_{bs} \to \infty$!
