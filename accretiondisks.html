          <h2>Accretion Disk Basics</h2>
          <p>
            Accretion disks are large disks of matter that rotate and swirl around gravitating bodies.
            I find them fascinating due to their ubiquity in the formation of bodies in space.
            They can be found around black holes, contact/close binary systems, and in the process of protoplanetary formation.
            Perhaps the most stunning and neighborly accretion disks are the rings around Saturn, which are formed mostly of ice and dust.
          </p>
          <p>
            This website will focus on the formation of accretion disks around black holes (and the gamma ray bursts that result).
            My secondary focus will be the accretion disks that form from close binary systems,
            in which a primary star will “suck” matter away from a secondary star in such a way that it forms a disk.

          <h2>Formations</h2>
          <p>
            Accretion disks that evolve into protostars (baby stars) are formed from clouds of material that are disturbed by an external trigger.
            This causes an instability in the cloud and material begins to combine at a point.
            With more gravitational attraction at that point than others, more particles are attracted to the point and accrete into a larger and larger structure.
            This snowballs into a protostar.
          </p>
          <p>
            Black hole accretion disks are simply formed by matter falling into a near-miss orbit around the black hole.
            The black hole will spin the matter into a disk because of its intense gravitational pull.
            The plane in which the accretion disk forms is related to the average angular momentum of the particles in the body or cloud being spun.
            The accretion disk will slowly shrink, since the matter isn’t in a stable orbit.
            The matter will only “disappear” if it’s around a black hole.
            If it’s around another gravitating body, it will simply accrete on the surface of the body.
            The matter spins around more quickly as it gets closer to the gravitating body in order to conserve angular momentum.

          <h2>Angular Momentum Transfer</h2>
          <p>
            As gas particles fall into the black hole, they must lose angular momentum.
            Although the particles themselves do not have constant angular momentum, the accretion disk does have constant angular momentum.
            This is due to angular momentum transport, in which the gas particles at a smaller radius from the black hole transfer
            angular momentum to particles at a larger radius.
            This can be done in two ways: wind and collisions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Magnetohydrodynamic winds are more complex than basic collisions. They wick away angular momentum from the entire disk.
            Read <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0306208v1.pdf">this paper</a> if you want more information on this.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, momentum redistribution is comparatively simple.
            Just as two bodies can transfer angular momentum as they collide, so can particles in the accretion disk.
            Modelling this transfer of angular momentum from the inside to the outside of the disk is somewhat complex.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some math follows for those of you that like that kind of thing.

          <h3>Loss of Potential</h3>
          <p>
            If we estimate a disk where its thickness or height is much less than its radius $( h \lt \lt r )$, we say:
            "Screw the third dimension, let's just deal with it as if it's a circle." (at least that's what I say)
            So then, as the accretion disk begins to "rain" its matter on the surface of the star, the angular momentum must be transferred
            outward.
          </p>
          <p>
            As some interior radius of the disk $ R $ falls inward, it must lose potential energy $ \Delta E = \frac {GM} {R^2} dMdR $. We can
            use this equation to find the luminosity of a disk, as the energy transferred into the disk and radiated outward is the total loss of potential in
            the material accreting to the surface of the gravitating body.

          <h2>Disk Luminosity</h2>
          <p>
            Accretion disks often become very bright due to the “fluid” nature of their structure.
            When matter is spun into an accretion disk, it is approximated to a fluid because of the numerous particles
            and pieces of material that are jostling against each other in their orbit.
            There is almost no stable orbit here for any given particle. We assume it to be just random motion.
            The whole disk can be assumed to be in a stable orbit but there isn’t any easy way to calculate the path of any given particle in the disk.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, due to this motion, we know that the disk will have a given temperature.
            Due to the number of particles and collisions, the temperatures can be so high that they give off X-rays!
            This temperature is caused by the collisions of material within the accretion disk.
            The disk also moves inward, toward the black hole.
            We know that the potential energy lost by accretion is Equation [1].
            Half of this energy is transferred into the rest of the disk, and half is radiated outward. Thus, the luminosity of a disk is represented by Equation [2].

          <h2>Astrophysical Jets</h2>
          <p>
            Astrophysical jets are extremely common in the universe.
            They are generated by many different bodies with accretion disks.
            The material ejected from the accretion disk along the axis of rotation of the gravitating often has a velocity
            equal to the escape velocity from that body’s gravitational pull at that radius!
            When jets are released from the pull of a black hole, they will reach incredibly large fractions of the speed of light,
            which are observed as gamma ray bursts.
            These are perhaps the most explosive and energetic events in the universe since the Big Bang.
            Gamma ray bursts can often have luminosities greater than 10<sup>50</sup> erg/s.
            In comparison, our Sun has a luminosity of approximately 2.8x10<sup>31</sup> erg/s.
            That’s 100,000,000,000,000,000,000 times brighter than our Sun.

          <h3>Jet Structure and Formation</h3>
          <p>
            Before diving into the velocity calculations of the jet, let's define a few terms. After a thorough reading of
            Elisebete M de Gouveia Dal Pino's wonderful research on <i> Astrophysical Jets and Outflows</i>, I found that her focus
            was on the structure and composition of an astrophysical jet, along with the ambient medium that it crashes through. As the jet is released
            from the grip of the body's gravity, it fires along the rotational axis of the body. The method by which it does this is mostly unknown. It
            most likely has to do with the magnetohydrodynamic structure of the disk. After firing, it will proceed to cool radiatively, and slow down
            through the collision with these ambient clouds. The clouds of gas that it runs through will be injected with angular momentum.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the jet collides with the gas cloud, debris is kicked up from the fast jet particles smacking against the relatively inert gas particles.
            This structure is called the <i>bow shock</i>. These bright knots formed by this collision are much more common in jets formed by active galactic
            nuclei (AGNs), which usually are concentrated at a central black hole. Young star objects (YSOs) move slowly compared to AGN jets, so they often create
            fewer bow shocks. Their total angular momentum is smaller than AGN jets, so it is completely dispersed after just a few collisions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, time for the equation! This relates bow shock velocity to actual jet velocity.
            $$ v_{bs} \approx v_j \frac 1 {1 + {(\eta\alpha)}^{-1/2}} $$
            The two variables at the bottom, $ \eta $ (eta) and $ \alpha $ (alpha) are defined as follows:
            $$ \eta = \frac {n_j} {n_a} $$
            where $ \frac {n_j} {n_a} $ is the ratio of the number density of the jet to ambient gas.
            $$ \alpha = (\frac {R_j} {R_h})^2 $$
            where $ R_j $ is the radius of the jet beam, and $ R_h $ the radius of the jet head.
          </p>
          <p>
            Quickly, a few reflections on this equation. If $ \eta \alpha \to \infty $, then $v_{bs} \approx v_j$. If $ \eta \alpha \to 0$, then $v_{bs} \lt\lt v_j$!
            These two limits can be approached in three different ways.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the density of the jet is high compared to the ambient gas, then $ \eta \alpha \to 0 $. Thus the bow shock is about the same velocity as the jet.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the head of the jet is large compared the beam (highly conic, with conic point at black hole source), then $ \eta \alpha \to 0 $.
            We get the same result as a highly dense jet.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, if the density of the cloud is denser than the jet, then $ \eta \alpha \to \infty $ and the bow shock is much slower than the jet.
          </p>
          <p>
            The shape of the jet would have to be narrowing as it propagates in order to produce this same result with $ (\frac {R_j} {R_h})^2 $. This is unrealistic.

          <h2> Black Hole Accretion: Tearing </h2>
          <p>
            Accretion disks that form around a black hole are typically presumed to be flat and axisymmetric,
            but over time, that ceases to happen. The warping of spacetime due to frame-dragging around a spinning
            black hole often causes forces to pull the accretion disks into different spins and orbits around the black hole.
            In <i>Tearing Up The Disk: How Black Holes Accrete</i>, the authors explain how this process occurs, and use equations to properly model the ripping
            that black holes cause in these accretion disks. The Lense-Thirring precession is stated to be the cause.
            The Lense-Thirring precession is due to frame-dragging in the presence of a spinning black hole.
            Frame-dragging is essentially the distortion of spacetime around a rotating gravitating body with lots of mass.
            This relativistic effect causes distant observers to observe that a clock ticks fastest when rotating around a massive body.
            The authors find an equation for the radius at which an accretion disk will “break” (separate due to torque from Lense-Thirring precession)
            which depends on the angle at which the accretion disk makes with the equator of the spinning black hole,
            the viscosity of the accretion disk, and the area of the disk. The equation
            $R_{break} \lt (\frac 4 3 | sin (\theta) | \frac {aR} {\alpha H})^{2/3} R_g$
            shows that at high viscosity, low spin, or small inclination angles the disk cannot be broken.
            However, if the black hole spins quickly, the viscosity of the gas is low, or the disk is at a very different angle than the equator,
            it is much more likely to break at a larger radius.

          <h3>Tearing Up The Disk: How Black Holes Accrete by Chris Nixon, Andrew King, Daniel Price, and Juhan Frank</h3>
          <p>
            This article was fairly accessible (I give it a 6/10) but was difficult. I found myself finding a lot of terms and
            equations in other sources in order to give myself the capability to understand most of it.
            I don’t think that it was written for an audience like me however, so it absolutely makes sense that some of it went
            over my head. I really enjoyed the pictures of the simulations at the end of the article, and the paragraph after
            the fully derived equation was easy to understand and intuitive. It was relevant to my project because it taught
            me more about black holes and accretion disks, but it also taught me that this is a truly vast topic. I feel like
            I’m going to have to do a lot of extra work to catch up to some of the more interesting topics about accretion disks around black holes.
          </p>
          <h3>Astrophysical Jets and Outflows by Elisabete M. de Gouveia dal Pino</h3>
          <p>
            This article held my interest and presented things in such a way that I could understand them easily without having to rely on
            Google too much(9/10 for accessibility). It is a great introduction to astrophysical jets, and although it did not go much into
            their relation with accretion disks, I was almost convinced to change my topic due to this paper.
            The diagrams and graphs within the article (and especially Section 3) are well-explained.
            I especially like the one of the jet head structure.

            I feel most comfortable with the high-level concepts that don't delve too deeply into thermodynamics or magnetohydrodynamics. Perhaps the most
            fun I had was finding the intricate simulations or bizarre behaviors of disks under stress. Black holes have always been a favorite topic of mine
            and now I feel like I can talk more about them. Accretion disks are an important part of black holes and bind my knowledge of black holes with my
            knowledge of stellar astrophysics. Not only that, but I've gotten more familiar with web development, and that was a fun side-effect of this project.

          <h3> What do you still wonder? What questions did this bring up or what is left unanswered even after your investigation?</h3>
          <p>
            I'm starting to wonder if I should go to graduate school after all. A PhD in computational astrophysics sounds really fun right about now.
            I want to sink a little more into the math of accretion disks. I feel like I would need to take a more guided curriculum for that. My random
            prodding into the depths of the academic body that researches this stuff has come up with a lot of deep insight into one area, without a broad
            understanding of how the areas are tethered. The question that pulls at me the hardest is perhaps the most important one: How do astrophysical jets form?
